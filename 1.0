# 1.0

**1.1 Given a scenario, analyze indicators of compromise and determine the type of malware**

- **Viruses -** attaches to host app - exe by user
- Sparse infector virus - sparatic behavior
- Multipartite virus - infects files and boot sector
- **Worm -** self replicating and travels network
- **Bots -** malware over network - DDoS
- **RAT -** Trojan with a backdoor

**1.2 Compare and contrast types of attacks**

- **Social Engineering -**
    - **Hoax -** false message
    - **Watering Hole Attack -** watching website traffic then infecting the website
- **Application/Service attacks -**
    - **MITM -** placed between two clients - reads, modifies, and forwards to user
    - **Injection -** inject SQL libraries to pass to back end server
    - **XSS -** attackers include code in input and the script becomes part of web process
    - **XSRF -** users perform action on web sites without their knowledge - session riding
    - **ARP poisoning -** who has this IP? here is my MAC - fake MAC is used
    - **Amplification -** massive DDoS attack
    - **DNS poisoning -** modifies the IP of the website and replaces it with one of a malicious website
    - **Man-in-the-browser -** intercept and manipulate comms. after the user leaves the website
    - **Pass the hash -** takes hash from the protocol that does not encrypt it and uses it to authenticate
    - **Hijacking and related attacks -**
        - **Clickjacking -** user clicks something but they're actually clicking the hidden control which is malicious transport layer code
        - **Session hijacking -** attacker gets SSID from cookies and impersonates the user
    - **Driver Manipulation -**
        - **Shimming -** putting a layer of code between driver and the OS to change OS not driver - DLL
        - **Refactoring -** rewriting existing code while maintaining functionality
    - Smurf attack - spoof IP address then the user gets flooded with ping requests and creates DoS
    - Xmas attack - attacker scans port with specific tags then find out what protocols are used
    - Pharming - web redirects to a fake site
    - Spimming - instant message
- **Wireless Attacks -**
    - **IV -** random number used for WEP encryption
    - **WPS -** press buttons or enter PIN to get into network
    - **Bluejacking -** unsolicited messages sent to device
    - **Bluesnarfing -** unauthorized access to device
    - **RFID -** one way communication between RFID tag and RFID reader - ApplePay
    - **NFC -** two way communication between RFID tag and RFID reader
- **Cryptographic attacks -**
    - **Birthday -** attackers steals hash and uses a list of passwords to find the hash
    - **Rainbow tables -** database with password hashes - use long passwords or salting
    - **Dictionary -** uses dictionary words to find password
    - **Collision -** when two passwords have the same hash
    - Hybrid - mix between dictionary and brute force
    - **Downgrade -** force system to use weak encryption

**1.4 Explain penetration concepts**

- **Active reconnaissance -** interact with the network - can detect
- **Passive reconnaissance -** open source - cannot be detected
- **Pivot -** attacks one machine then moves their tools and attacks the network/system
- **Black box -** no knowledge
- **White box -** full knowledge (documentation, source code, logon details)
- **Gray box -** some knowledge

**Common Tools -**

- **Nmap and Zenmap -** port scanner
- **Wireshark -** traffic analyzer
- **Nessus -** vulnerability scanner
- **Tripwire -** file integrity checker
- **Metasploitable -** Linux box for pen testing
- **Back Orifice -** password sniffer and remote admin tool (undetected)
- **OpenVAS -** Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner
- **Cain & Abel -** Windows password recovery, sniffer, brute force, cryptanalysis
- **John the Ripper** - password cracker
- **pfSense -** open source firewall/router
- **Security Onion -** open source IDS
- **SourceForge -** open source project management
- **DBAN -** erase hard drives, desktops, laptops, servers
- **Roo -**

**1.5 Explain vulnerability scanning concepts**

- **Credentialed scan -** scanning with admin creds
- **Non-credentialed scan -** starting without admin creds then getting them through escalation

**1.6 Explain the impact associated with types of vulnerabilities**

- **Memory/buffer vulnerability**
    - **Memory leak -** unclean memory resources that don't get cleared out
    - **Integer overflow -** create numeric value that is too big for the system to handle
    - **Buffer overflow -** input is larger than data can hold
    - **Pointer dereference -** change memory location
    - **DLL injection -** adding DLL libraries
