   **5.1 Explain the importance of policies, plans, and procedures related to organizational security**

   - **Standard operating procedure -** step-by-step instructions employees can use to perform common tasks
   - **Agreement types -**
        - **BPA -** relationship and obligations between partners - good to settle conflict
        - **SLA -** performance expectations from vendors and customer
        - **ISA -** technical and security requirements for a secure connection
        - **MOU/MOA -** not as strict as SLA or ISA but still has the same level of importance
    - **Personnel management -**
        - **Role-based awareness training -**
            - **Data owner -** classify the data
            - **Systems administrator -** responsible for overall security
            - **System owner -** high level executive with overall responsibility - they should receiving training on how the systems work
            - **User -** train them
            - **Privileged user  -** admin rights
            - **Executive user -** need high-level briefings related to risk

   **5.2 Business impact analysis concepts**

   - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective) -** how long it can take to restore a system after an outage
    - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective) -** point where data loss is acceptable - anything past is unacceptable
    - **MTBF (Mean time between failures)**
    - **MTTR (Mean time to restore/recovery)**
    - **MTTF (Mean time to failure)**
    - **Privacy impact assessment -** identify potential risks related to PII - comply with laws and regs
    - **Privacy threshold assessment -** analysis if PII was collected and maintained by a system

   **5.3 Explain risk management processes and concepts**

   - **Risk assessment -**
        - **SLE -** single loss expectancy - based on exposure factor (EF) and asset value
        - **ALE -** annual loss expectancy - = SLE *ARO
        - **ARO -** annualized rate of occurrence
        - **Risk register -** info on risks

   **5.4 Given a scenario, follow incident response procedures**

   - **Incident response process -**
        - **Preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, lesson's learned**

   **5.5 Basic concepts of forensices**

   - **Order of volatility -**
        1. CPU cache & register
        2. Routing tables, ARP cache, process tables, kernel stats
        3. Live network connections and data flow
        4. RAM
        5. Temp files, swap or paging files
        6. Hard drive data
        7. Logs stored on remote systems
        8. Archived media
    - **Data acquisition -** capture system image, network traffic and logs, capture video, record time offset, take hashes, screenshots, witness interviews

   **5.6 Explain disaster recovery and continuity of operations concepts**

   - **Backup concepts -**
        - **Differential -** backs up data that changed since last full backup
        - **Incremental -** backs up data that changed since last full backup or last incremental

   **5.7 Compare and contrast various types of controls**
    - **Deterrent -** discourage attacker - law, warning sign, lights, login banner (only authorized)
    - **Preventive -** mantrap prevents tailgating, firewall, lockout policies
    - **Detective -** detect breach - IDS, motion detection
    - **Corrective -** post event effort to minimize extent of damage
    - **Compensating -** restore using different methods - backups
    - **Technical -** aka logical control - technology implementation
    - **Administrative -** policy, procedure, testing
    - **Physical -** prevents physical action from occurring

   **5.8 Given a scenario, carry out data security and privacy practices**

   - **Data destruction and media sanitization -**
        - **Burning, shredding,**
        - **Pulping -** puree paper
        - **Pulverizing -** sledge hammer destroying
        - **Degaussing -** electomagnetic removal
        - **Purging -** general term for removing sensitive data
        - **Wiping -** overwriting
    - **Data sensitivity labeling and handling -**
        - **Proprietary -** data related to the owner
    - **Data roles -**
        - **Owner -** responsible for the data
        - **Steward -** responsible for accuracy, privacy, and sensitivity labels
        - **Custodian -** routine tasks on the data and sets security controls
        - **Privacy officer -** comply with laws, set policies, processes, and procedure
