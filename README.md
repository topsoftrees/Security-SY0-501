# Security-SY0-501
**Study method:** I went hard at it for 3 weeks when I started studying for about 4+hrs/day (again on top of classes and work) then got burned out. I would take a half a week-week off and forget stuff. This cycled over until 1.5 weeks before my exam. The 1.5 weeks leading up to the actual exam, I had some time to study so I sat down and said "okay, we gotta take this before things get even busier" so I set a date to take it a 1.5 weeks later. I cannot recommend enough scheduling the exam when you go over all the objectives once, even just reading a book or watching a video course once. Schedule the exam early so you don't keep putting it off like I did. 

I tried a bunch of different methods of studying but...

**What actually helped me:**

- Print the exam objectives and get familiar with them.
- Read All-in-One and highlighted to get acquainted with the material.
- Read GCGA and took some notes on paper but gave up.
- Took Dion's practice exams and scored between 50-55% first try then went over why my answers were incorrect.
- Read All-in-One again and took light handwritten notes based off the objectives (only notes on things I for sure didn't know and even they weren't too in-depth).
- Took Dion's practice exams and scored between 65-75% first try then went over why my answers were incorrect.
- Went over notes from All-in-One again.
- Did the questions that covered objective 1 then 2 and so on from Lachance and Clarke Practice Exams. The book isn't setup objective by objective but I did it objective-by-objective to find areas I needed more practice. I created an excel sheet with each objective and highlighted the ones I got wrong. I wrote out the reason why I got an answer wrong or why I struggled with a question. Why the answer is what it is and why it's not the one I thought it was or could be. This was by far the greatest method that helped me. Churning out questions and going over the choices. I absolutely think if I did this more than 4 days before my exam, I would have gotten a much higher score.
- Went through u/1unusualredditor's study guide and wrote out the things I did not have in my notes.
- Did the practice questions posted by u/digitalplanet_.
- More practice questions from Dion, and Lachance and Clarke

**Testing experience:** I had 81 questions total, 5 being PBQs. Mine didn't cover one topic more than another but there was a lot on types of attacks and networking which are a nice portion of the objectives. I looked at the PBQs at the beginning then skipped them keeping them in the back of my mind. I completed all the questions then went back to PBQs then flagged questions and submitted it with one second left. I didn't have any issues and cleared literally everything out of the room I took it in. 

Sorry this is long but hopefully it helps someone in finding good resources or methods.
